Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
at 0 ps, Instance /tbcpu/uut/comWB/ : Warning: There is an 'U'|'X'|'W'|'Z'|'-' in an arithmetic operand, the result will be 'X'(es).
Finished circuit initialization process.
ERROR: at 775 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "C:/Users/Administrator/CPU/RISC-CPU/RISC-CPU/ACctrl.vhd" Line 62. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.

INFO: Simulator is stopped.
